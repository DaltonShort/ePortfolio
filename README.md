## Enhancement links and descriptions:
- [Enhancement 1: ](https://github.com/DaltonShort/ePortfolio/blob/main/Inventory%20app%20Files.zip) This entry is a simple Inventory app for android devices. The primary enhancement here happened with the main inventory screen. Originally the screen had to be a grid layout due to assignment restrictions. This was switched to a constraint layout with a RecyclerView widget so the screen looked less cluttered with lines and was easy to scroll through any amount of items. I also changed how to move between screens to be more intuitive.
- [Enahncement 2: ](https://github.com/DaltonShort/ePortfolio/tree/main/Enhancement%20two) Simple command line application to log and keep track of rescue animals as well as training, employment, and other relevant data. The enhancement was to port the language from Java(eclipse oxygen) to C++(visual studio 2022).
- [Enhancement 3: ](https://github.com/DaltonShort/ePortfolio/tree/main/Enhancement%203) This enhancement follows the previous entry by added databse functionality with SQLite for local data storage.

## Professional Self Assessment:
The Biggest strength expressed in my ePortfolio is foundational knowledge and interest. To elaborate, the enhancements display proficiency in two multiple programming languages like Java and c++ (there's also XML if you count that). Additionally, the querying language SQL is used, but also integrated with another language. It also showed competency in creating applications for multiple operating systems and even basic terminal interaction to set the SQLite software up properly. All this is to say that in order to complete such a wide array of tasks, a strong basis of knowledge for computers in general is important. 

_Keyword topics:_
- _Team Environment Collaboration_- The code review displays the ability to critically analyze short source code to professionally point out weaknesses and potential improvements in a constructive and collaborative manner.
