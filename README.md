#### Keyword topics:
- _Team Environment Collaboration_- The code review displays the ability to critically analyze short source code to professionally point out weaknesses and potential improvements in a constructive and collaborative manner.
- _Communication With Stakeholders_ - This is demonstrated in the narratives that accompany each enhancement. It is largely free of jargon and reads like you are in my head during the process.
- _Data Structures and Algorithms_ - Although it is mainly demonstrated within my second enhancement, the language port, through demonstrating an understanding of types of data and efficient algorithms. It is also shown through the decision to keep the application command line was an intentional decision. Keeping the application command line allows for a less intensive application with quicker respond and update times.
- _Security_ - This subject was not displayed very well. The queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks, but that is the bare minimum.

## Professional Self Assessment:
#### The coursework throughout this program has helped me showcase my strengths, shaped my goals and values, and prepare to enter the computer science industry:
- _Showcase of Strengths_ - The program had me revisit some assignments from previous classes and reflect/improve upon them. This allowed me to identify areas i struggle or excel in. The chosen artifacts for the portfolio not only displays strengths, but also the ability to self reflect and minimize weaknesses.
- _Shaped Goals and Values_ - Seeing the growth from where I started helped to elevate my goals of employment. Although this is at the end of my bachelor's degree path, i had no prior knowledge of computers or software at all. I also had no clue where i was going to end up. But through this program i noticed my interest in software engineering/development.
- _Preparednees to Enter CS Industry_ - Besides the obvious answer of producing this ePortfolio, the program has also helped to prepare me by improving my confidence in my skillset. 
  
#### Enhancement Links and Artifact Justification:
- [Enhancement 1: ](https://github.com/DaltonShort/ePortfolio/blob/main/Inventory%20app%20Files.zip) The original artifact was an android mobile app to implement an inventory system. This included a login, a local database, sms text messages upon low stock, and more. These were imposed because it was an assignment from a previous class, and that is what brings us to the enhancement. Originally, the main screen was required to be a grid layout and have certain elements and widgets. With these restrictions rescinded, it was redesigned with the constraint layout XML format and employed the use of a recycler view so the user could scroll through an alphabetically organized indefinite list. The other change was the flow of the app's screens. Button widgets on every screen were reorganized to be much more uniform and the screen is much more aesthetically pleasing with the constraint layout design. _**Individually, this artifact enhancement displays the ability to design efficient flow and uniformity of an application, as opposed to UI design. It contributes to the portfolio as a whole by establishing familiarity with a popular OS, IDE, programming language, querying language, and database, SQLite.**_
- [Enahncement 2: ](https://github.com/DaltonShort/ePortfolio/tree/main/Enhancement%20two) The original application was also an assignment from a previous class. This application was originally a command line program made in Eclipse to track the induction, training, and deployment of emergency rescue dogs and monkeys. This was a very early class so no permanent data storage was implemented. Upon the program starting, it adds three dogs and monkeys to a list. Upon termination, the lists are destroyed. It also had functionality to update different data about the animals. The enhancement displayed here, is porting it from Java to C++. **_Individually, this artifact presents competency with another popular IDE and programming language. It contributes to the portfolio by demonstrating the ability to transcripe source code and keep all the functionality._**
- [Enhancement 3: ](https://github.com/DaltonShort/ePortfolio/tree/main/Enhancement%203) The final enhancement continues using the previous artifact. Once the program was ported, it still did not use any form of storage. So this artifact adds SQLite to the program for secure and efficient local data storage. **_This artifact reinforces the skill of integrating queries into code by adding another language. It is also demonstrates my habit of organization and naming conventions that match the industry standard._**
